# Generative Adversarial Networks Specialization on Coursera (offered by deeplearning.ai)

Programming assignments from all courses in the Coursera [GAN Specialization](https://www.deeplearning.ai/generative-adversarial-networks-specialization/) offered by `deeplearning.ai`.

## Courses

The GAN Specialization on Coursera contains three courses:

1. [Course 1: Build Basic Generative Adversarial Networks](https://www.coursera.org/learn/build-basic-generative-adversarial-networks-gans)

2. [Course 2: Build Better Generative Adversarial Networks](https://www.coursera.org/learn/build-better-generative-adversarial-networks-gans)

3. [Course 3: Apply Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/apply-generative-adversarial-networks-gans)

## About GANs

- Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are powerful machine learning models capable of generating realistic image, video, and voice outputs. 

- Rooted in game theory, GANs have wide-spread application: from improving cybersecurity by fighting against adversarial attacks and anonymizing data to preserve privacy to generating state-of-the-art images, colorizing black and white images, increasing image resolution, creating avatars, turning 2D images to 3D, and more.   

- As computing power has increased, so has the popularity of GANs and its capabilities. GANs have opened up many new directions: from generating high amounts of datasets for training machine learning models and allowing for powerful unsupervised learning models to producing sharper, discrete, and more accurate outputs. GANs have also informed research in adjacent areas like adversarial learning, adversarial examples and attacks, model robustness, etc.

## About this Specialization

- The deeplearning.ai [Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) Specialization](https://bit.ly/3bxUX44) provides an exciting introduction to image generation with GANs, charting a path from foundational concepts to advanced techniques through an easy-to-understand approach. It also covers social implications, including bias in ML and the ways to detect it, privacy preservation, and more.

- Build a comprehensive knowledge base and gain hands-on experience in GANs. Train your own model using PyTorch, use it to create images, and evaluate a variety of advanced GANs.

## About you

- This Specialization is for software engineers, students, and researchers from any field, who are interested in machine learning and want to understand how GANs work.

- This Specialization provides an accessible pathway for all levels of learners looking to break into the GANs space or apply GANs to their own projects, even without prior familiarity with advanced math and machine learning research.

## Disclaimer

I recognize the hard time people spend on building intuition, understanding new concepts and debugging assignments. The solutions uploaded here are **only for reference**. They are meant to unblock you if you get stuck somewhere. Please do not copy any part of the code as-is (the programming assignments are fairly easy if you read the instructions carefully). Similarly, try out the quizzes yourself before you refer to the quiz solutions.
