About GANs

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are powerful machine learning models capable of generating realistic image, video, and voice outputs.   Rooted in game theory, GANs have wide-spread application: from improving cybersecurity by fighting against adversarial attacks and anonymizing data to preserve privacy to generating state-of-the-art images, colorizing black and white images, increasing image resolution, creating avatars, turning 2D images to 3D, and more. 

# Applied-Project

Course 1: You will understand the fundamental components of GANs, build a basic GAN using PyTorch, use convolutional layers to build advanced DCGANs that processes images, apply W-Loss function to solve the vanishing gradient problem, and learn how to effectively control your GANs and build conditional GANs.

 Course 2: You will understand the challenges of evaluating GANs, compare different generative models, use the Fr√©chet Inception Distance (FID) method to evaluate the fidelity and diversity of GANs, identify sources of bias and the ways to detect it in GANs, and learn and implement the techniques associated with the state-of-the-art StyleGAN.

Course 3: You will use GANs for data augmentation and privacy preservation, survey more applications of GANs, and build Pix2Pix and CycleGAN for image translation.
